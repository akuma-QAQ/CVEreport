In the upload.cgi component of wavlink_WN551X3, there exists a buffer overflow vulnerability.

Trigger condition: When upload.cgi parses cookies, it copies a certain cookie value into a fixed-size stack buffer without performing bounds checking.

## Affected Path and Trigger Surface
- Binary: `/etc/lighttpd/www/cgi-bin/upload.cgi`
- Trigger surface:
  - Reads `HTTP_COOKIE` (from the HTTP `Cookie:` header).
  - Parses a target cookie key and copies its value into a fixed-size stack buffer without length checks.
- Observed behaviors:
  - Direct execution with `HTTP_COOKIE` injected causes `SIGSEGV` (exit code `139`) and kernel logs indicate `Comm: upload.cgi`.
